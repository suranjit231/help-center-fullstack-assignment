## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
  - I used Redux Toolkit to share functionality across a component tree because it provides a centralized state management solution, enabling different components to access and update shared state efficiently.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
  - The useState hook is appropriate for handling state in a complex component because it allows for local state management, making state updates and re-renders efficient and isolated within the component.
